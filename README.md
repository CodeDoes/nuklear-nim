Nim bindings for https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear/ 

These are Nim bindings to the Nuklear Immediate GUI library : https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear/ 

The bindings do work - see https://github.com/zacharycarter/nuklear-nim/blob/master/testNuklear2.nim - 
for an example using GLFW and OpenGL.

This repository is a WIP and will be undergoing heavy changes over the next month or so. The bindings should be relatively stable - 
some more functionality from Nuklear will be added over time.
